# ProstaCare — Complete Patient Data Walkthrough (worked example)

**Purpose:** show, stage by stage with real values, exactly **what a clinician enters**, **what records the system creates**, **which nudges fire or resolve**, and **what is derived**. Two journeys: a **new patient** (onboarding) and an **existing patient** (follow-up → response → progression). Ends with the **complete record summary**, the **derived layer**, and **fill-in examples** so the clinical team can answer the remaining open questions.

**Notation:** `1:1` = one row per patient · `1:N` = a dated log (append-only) · **derived** = computed, never typed.
All field keys and values come from the workbook `Field_Dictionary` / `Value_Lists`.

# PART A — NEW PATIENT ONBOARDING

**Meet `PCR-005`** — 66-year-old man, referred from a government OPD in Uttar Pradesh, PMJAY coverage, newly diagnosed.

## Stage 1 — Clinical workup (complaint, DRE, biopsy, PSA)

**Screen:** *Clinical Assessment*.

**1a. Presenting complaint & DRE** → written to **`pathology` (1:1)**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `primary_complaint` | LUTS (Lower urinary tract symptoms) |
| `duration` | 6 months |
| `ipss_score` | 20–35 (Severe) |
| `bowel_rectal_symptoms` | None |
| `dre_findings` | Nodule – bilateral |
| `prostate_volume_cc` | 54 |

**1b. PSA history** → each entry appends a **`psa_reading` (1:N dated)** row

| `psa_date` | `psa_ng_ml` | `free_psa_pct` | `psa_density` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-10 | 28.4 | 8 | 0.53 |
| 2026-06-20 | 34.1 | 7 | 0.63 |

**1c. Biopsy** → written to **`pathology` (same 1:1 row)**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `biopsy_date` | 2026-07-01 |
| `biopsy_type` | MRI-targeted / Fusion biopsy |
| `pi_rads_score` | PI-RADS 5 |
| `gleason_score` | 4+5=9 |
| `isup_grade_group` | Grade 5 (≥4+5) |
| `cores_positive_total` | 9 / 12 |
| `core_involvement_pct` | 71 |
| `perineural_invasion` | Present |
| `ece_extracapsular_extension` | Present (radiological) |

**1d. Comorbidities & family history** → **boolean flags on `pathology`**
`comorbidity_1` (T2 Diabetes) = **Yes** · `comorbidity_2` (Hypertension) = **Yes** · others No
`family_history_2` (Breast Ca) = **Yes** · others No

---

## Stage 2 — Staging & imaging (the moment nudges wake up)

**2a. TNM & risk** → appends **`staging_assessment` (1:N dated)** — *row #1*

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `assessed_on` | 2026-07-05 |
| `clinical_t_stage` | cT3b |
| `n_stage` | cN1 |
| `m_stage` | cM0 |
| `eau_risk_category` | **Very High / Locally Advanced** |
| `ecog_performance_status` | 1 – Restricted strenuous activity |
| `castration_status` | **Not on ADT** *(pre-treatment)* |

**2b. Imaging & molecular** → appends **`imaging_study` (1:N dated)** rows — **only for studies actually performed**

| `study_date` | `modality` | `result` |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-06-25 | `mpmri_pelvis` | Done — abnormal |
| 2026-06-26 | `ct_abdomen_pelvis` | Done — lymphadenopathy |

> **Important:** "Not done" is **the absence of a row**, not a row with an empty date.
> `bone_scan_spect`, `psma_pet_ct`, `dexa_bone_density`, `germline_somatic_testing` have **no rows yet** → the engine reads them as `Not done`:
> `imaging_status(m) = latest imaging_study row for modality m, else "Not done"`

### ⚠ The care-gap engine runs (on save). Current state → 8 rules:

```
current_risk       = Very High / Locally Advanced      (staging row #1)
current_castration = Not on ADT                        (staging row #1)
bone_scan = Not done · psma = Not done · dexa = Not done · germline = Not done
bone_protection = Not started (no supportive-care row yet)
next_follow_up_psa_date = (empty) · phq9 = Not done

1 bone_scan_missing       Not done AND risk∈{High,VeryHigh,M1}   → FIRES  🔴 Urgent
2 psma_missing            Not done AND risk∈{High,VeryHigh}      → FIRES  🔴 Urgent
3 bone_protection_missing Not started                            → FIRES  🔴 Urgent
4 dexa_missing            Not done                               → FIRES  🟠 Warning
5 genomics_missing        Not done                               → FIRES  🟠 Warning
6 arsi_readiness          castration ≠ HSPC                      → does NOT fire ✅
7 followup_psa_missing    date empty                             → FIRES  🔵 Info
8 psychosocial_prompt     phq9 = Not done                        → FIRES  🔵 Info
```
**Result: 7 open nudges** — 3 Urgent · 2 Warning · 2 Info.
**Records created:** 7 × `nudge` + 7 × `nudge_event(opened)`.
**Banner:** *"Urgent: 3 actions require immediate attention."* · **Primary focus:** "Complete bone scan / SPECT".

> **Note rule 6 gating:** ARSI does not fire yet because the patient is not on ADT. It will fire the moment castration status becomes HSPC (Stage 4). This is why staging is a **dated log**, not a cell.

---

## Stage 3 — MDT review

**Screen:** *Treatment Plan → Intent & MDT* → **`treatment_plan` (1:1)**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `treatment_intent` | Disease control (locally advanced) |
| `mdt_tumour_board_status` | Reviewed — plan agreed |
| `date_of_mdt_review` | 2026-07-08 |
| `clinical_trial_eligibility` | Not screened |
| `treatment_start_date` | 2026-07-10 |

**Derived:** `mdt_review_rate` numerator +1 · `time_to_treatment = 2026-07-10 − 2026-06-28 = 12 days`.

---

## Stage 4 — Treatment starts (and the ARSI nudge wakes)

**4a. Therapy** → appends **`treatment_line` (1:N dated)** rows

| # | `line_type` | `agent` / `formulation_dose` | `start_date` | `status` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ADT | LHRH Agonist (Leuprolide / Lupride) · Leuprolide 45 mg depot (6-monthly) | 2026-07-10 | Active |
| 2 | Anti-androgen | Bicalutamide 50 mg OD (flare cover) | 2026-07-10 | Active (ends 2026-08-07) |

**4b. Castration status changes** → appends **`staging_assessment` — row #2** *(never overwrites row #1)*

| `assessed_on` | `eau_risk_category` | `castration_status` |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-10 | Very High / Locally Advanced | **Hormone-sensitive (HSPC)** |

**4c. Supportive care** → appends **`supportive_care_event` (1:N dated)** — row #1

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `bone_protection_therapy` | **Not started** |
| `calcium_vitamin_d` | Not prescribed |
| `next_follow_up_psa_date` | **2026-10-10** |
| `testosterone_monitoring` | Not checked this cycle |
| `psychosocial_screening_phq9` | Not done |
| `nutritional_assessment` | Not done |

### ⚠ Engine re-runs — two nudges change state
```
current_castration = Hormone-sensitive (HSPC)     ← from staging row #2
next_follow_up_psa_date = 2026-10-10              ← from supportive row #1

6 arsi_readiness   HSPC AND risk⊇High AND arsi=Not initiated → FIRES 🟠 Warning  (NEW)
7 followup_psa_missing   date now present                    → AUTO-RESOLVES ✅
```
**Result: 7 open nudges** — 3 Urgent · 3 Warning · 1 Info.
`nudge_event(opened)` for ARSI · `nudge_event(resolved)` for follow-up. **Nobody clicked "resolve"** — the data did it.

---

## Stage 5 — RT plan + journey events

**RT** → appends **`treatment_line`** row #3

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `line_type` | RT |
| `rt_indication` | Definitive RT (prostate ± LN) |
| `rt_status` | Planned |
| `rt_modality` | IMRT / VMAT |
| `target_volume` | Prostate + Whole Pelvis |
| `dose_fractionation` | 78 Gy / 39 fx (conventional) |
| `rt_facility` | Govt. Regional Cancer Centre |
| `planned_rt_start_date` | 2026-09-01 |
| `cghs_preauth_status` | Not required *(PMJAY, not CGHS)* |

**Journey events** → **`journey_event` (1:N dated)**
`Outpatient Visit` 2026-06-28 · `Lab / PSA` 2026-05-10 · `Imaging` 2026-06-25 · `Biopsy / Procedure` 2026-07-01 · `MDT Review` 2026-07-08 · `Treatment Initiation` 2026-07-10

# PART B — EXISTING PATIENT (follow-up → response → progression)

**Meet `PCR-001`** — the workbook's case: 68 y, High risk, HSPC, CGHS, on ADT with **7 open nudges** at the start.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[7 open nudges] --> B[Close the workup gaps]
  B --> C[Start bone protection + ARSI]
  C --> D[0 open nudges ✅]
  D --> E[18 months: PSA rises]
  E --> F[Restage → CRPC]
  F --> G[New line: chemo]
```

## B1 — Closing the gaps (each append auto-resolves a nudge)

| Date | Clinician action | Row appended | Nudge effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-15 | Bone scan performed | `imaging_study` (Bone Scan, *Done — no metastases*) | 🔴 `bone_scan_missing` → **resolved** |
| 2026-08-20 | PSMA PET-CT performed | `imaging_study` (PSMA, *Done — pelvic nodal uptake*) | 🔴 `psma_missing` → **resolved** |
| 2026-09-01 | Bone protection started | `supportive_care_event` (Zoledronic acid 4 mg IV q3m; Calcium+VitD prescribed) | 🔴 `bone_protection_missing` → **resolved** |
| 2026-09-05 | DEXA done | `imaging_study` (DEXA, *Osteopenia (T −1 to −2.5)*) | 🟠 `dexa_missing` → **resolved** |
| 2026-09-08 | Germline result | `imaging_study` (Germline, *BRCA1/2 — negative*) | 🟠 `genomics_missing` → **resolved** |
| 2026-09-10 | ARSI initiated | `treatment_line` (ARSI · Abiraterone + Prednisone) | 🟠 `arsi_readiness` → **resolved** |
| 2026-09-12 | PHQ-9 completed | `supportive_care_event` (PHQ-9 *Minimal (0–4)*) | 🔵 `psychosocial_prompt` → **resolved** |

**Open nudges: 7 → 0.** Every closure is a `nudge_event(resolved)`; nothing was manually dismissed.
*(This is why there is no "dismiss" button — see `SIMPLIFICATION_REVIEW.md`.)*

## B2 — Response, then progression (append-only shows the whole arc)

**PSA log (`psa_reading`, 1:N):**
| Date | PSA | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-01 | 42.6 | baseline |
| 2026-11-01 | 4.2 | responding |
| 2027-02-01 | **0.6** | **nadir** |
| 2027-11-01 | 3.4 | rising |
| 2028-01-10 | 8.1 | rising on castrate testosterone |

**Restaging** → `staging_assessment` **row #3** (rows #1 and #2 untouched)
| `assessed_on` | `eau_risk_category` | `castration_status` |
|---|---|---|
| 2028-01-15 | `M1 – Metastatic HSPC` *(see note)* | **Castration-resistant (CRPC)** |

> ⚠️ **Enum limitation for the clinical team (E3):** the `eauRiskCategory` list has only `M1 – Metastatic HSPC` — there is **no `M1 – CRPC` value**. So a metastatic patient who becomes castration-resistant carries a risk label that still says "HSPC", while `castration_status` correctly says CRPC. **Should we add `M1 – Metastatic CRPC` to the risk enum, or is castration_status alone sufficient?**

**New line** → `treatment_line` row #4: `chemo` · Docetaxel 75 mg/m² q3w · start 2028-02-01

**Outcome (1:1) updated:**
`psa_nadir_value` 0.6 · `psa_nadir_date` 2027-02-01 · `psa_doubling_time_months` 4.8 ·
`biochemical_recurrence_status` Biochemical recurrence · `crpc_progression_status` **Progressed to CRPC** · `crpc_progression_date` 2028-01-15

**Engine effect:** `arsi_readiness` **cannot re-fire** (castration ≠ HSPC). The HSPC→CRPC transition is preserved as a **dated fact**, which is exactly why staging is a log.

## B3 — Completing the record (the fields the first pass skipped)

These close every remaining gap against the Field Dictionary. `PCR-001` is **CGHS**, so the pre-auth flow applies.

**CGHS pre-auth for RT** → updates the RT `treatment_line`
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `cghs_preauth_status` | Not initiated → **Pending** → **Approved** |
| `cghs_request_date` | 2026-09-20 |
| `cghs_approval_date` | 2026-11-06 |
→ **derived** `cghs_delay = 47 days` (feeds the access-delay chart)

**RT delivered & assessed** → RT `treatment_line` + `outcome`
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `rt_status` | Completed |
| `rt_completion_date` | 2027-01-20 |
| `rt_outcome_status` | Complete biochemical response |

**Testosterone & toxicity** → `supportive_care_event` + `treatment_line`
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `testosterone_level` | 18 ng/dL |
| `testosterone_monitoring` | Castrate confirmed (<50 ng/dL) |
| `safety_side_effects` | Grade 1 fatigue; hot flushes — no dose change |

**Chemotherapy detail** (the 2028 line) → `treatment_line` (`line_type` = chemo)
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `chemotherapy_regimen` | Docetaxel 75 mg/m² q3w |
| `number_of_cycles_completed` | 6 |
| `last_cycle_date` | 2028-06-12 |

**Follow-up & recurrence** → `outcome` (1:1)
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `last_follow_up_date` | 2028-06-20 |
| `best_response` | Biochemical recurrence |
| `biochemical_recurrence_date` | 2027-11-01 |

> `last_follow_up_date` + `next_follow_up_psa_date` are what drive the **Patient List** segments (Last Visit / Upcoming / Missed-Overdue) — which is why we need **no Encounter entity**.

**PSA remarks** → `psa_reading.context_remarks` — e.g. *"post-RT, on ADT + abiraterone"*
**Journey events** → `journey_event` (`event_type`, `event_date`, `event_notes`) — e.g. `Adverse Event` · 2028-03-04 · *"Grade 2 neutropenia, cycle delayed 1 week"*
**Rx upload** → `document` — `rx_upload` accepts PDF/image; stored with uploader + timestamp, audited.

# PART D — DERIVED DATA & LOGIC OUTPUTS (never typed)

## D1 — Current state (latest dated row per log)
```
current_risk        = M1                        ← staging row #3 (2028-01-15)
current_castration  = Castration-resistant      ← staging row #3
current_line        = chemo (Docetaxel)         ← treatment_line row #4
latest_psa          = 8.1 ng/mL (2028-01-10)    ← psa_reading latest
bone_protection     = Zoledronic acid 4 mg q3m  ← supportive_care latest
```
→ drives the **header badges** and the **rule inputs**.

## D2 — Per-patient derived values
| Derived | Formula | Value |
|---|---|---|
| ADT duration | `today − ADT start` | 19 months |
| Time to treatment | `treatment_start − diagnosis_date` | 12 days *(PCR-005)* |
| PSA nadir / PSADT | from `psa_reading` + `outcome` | 0.6 @ 2027-02 · 4.8 mo |
| Open gap counts | `COUNT(nudge WHERE status=open GROUP BY severity)` | 0 / 0 / 0 |
| Record completeness | % required fields present per field group | 94% |

## D3 — Cohort roll-up (this patient's contribution)
| Cohort metric | How PCR-001 contributes |
|---|---|
| `psma_completion_rate` | numerator **+1**, denominator +1 (high-risk) |
| `bone_protection_rate` | numerator **+1**, denominator +1 (on ADT) |
| `arsi_intensification_rate` | numerator **+1**, denominator +1 (HSPC high-risk at the time) |
| `mdt_review_rate` | numerator +1 |
| `open_gap_count` | **0** (was 7) |
| `protocol_adherence_score` | pulls the cohort score **up** |

## D4 — What leaves the tenant (sponsor)
Only the de-identified aggregate row, small-cell suppressed:
```
institution_code = INST-017 | period_month = 2026-09 | metric_key = bone_protection_rate
dim1 = risk_group/High     | numerator = 18 | denominator = 62 | patient_n = 62 | suppressed = false
```
❌ Never: `patient_code`, names, exact dates, free text, or any cell with `patient_n < 11`.

# PART E — OPEN QUESTIONS, MADE ANSWERABLE (examples for the clinical team)

## E1 — Enum localisation per site *(the concrete ask)*
The workbook ships **national default lists**. Each institution may need local values. Please fill in for the launch site:

**RT Facility** — default list: *AIIMS New Delhi · Tata Memorial Centre · RGCI Delhi · Max Cancer Centre · Fortis · Govt. Regional Cancer Centre*
| Your site's RT facilities (add/remove) |
|---|
| e.g. `SGPGI Lucknow — LINAC 1 (VMAT)` |
| e.g. `SGPGI Lucknow — LINAC 2 (IMRT)` |
| e.g. `Kalyan Singh Super Speciality Cancer Institute` |
| ☐ *Or: keep the national list as-is* |

**Referring Hospital / Centre** — default: *AIIMS New Delhi · Tata Memorial · CMC Vellore · PGIMER · RGCI · SGPGI · Government General Hospital · Private Urologist / Clinic*
| Your site's real referrers |
|---|
| e.g. `District Hospital, Barabanki` · `District Hospital, Sitapur` |
| e.g. `Balrampur Hospital, Lucknow` |
| ☐ *Or: keep the national list* |

**Healthcare Coverage** — the national schemes are fixed (PMJAY · CGHS · ESIC · Private · Self-pay), but the **State Scheme** name varies:
| State | State-scheme name to display |
|---|---|
| Andhra Pradesh / Telangana | Aarogyasri |
| Maharashtra | Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana |
| Tamil Nadu | CM's Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme |
| Rajasthan | Chiranjeevi / Rajya Bima |
| **Your state** | ______________________ |

**Language preference** — trim the national list to what your site actually needs (e.g. UP site: Hindi, English, Urdu).
**ADT formulations** — confirm locally stocked brands/doses (e.g. add `Triptorelin 22.5 mg (6-monthly)` if used).

## E2 — Record lock durations *(B3b)*
Pick the scenario that matches your clinic:
| Scenario | Suggested `EDIT_WINDOW` |
|---|---|
| Data entered **live in clinic**, corrected same session | **24 h** |
| Entered by the clinician **later the same day / next morning** | **48 h** *(our default)* |
| Batched entry by a registrar **within the week** | **72 h – 7 days** |

And: **HOD unlock window** 24 h — enough to fix and re-save? Should a **Coordinator** also unlock? ☐ Yes ☐ No

## E3 — Care-gap rule tuning *(B8)*
For each rule, confirm or amend:
| Rule | Current condition | Amend to…? |
|---|---|---|
| `bone_scan_missing` | risk ∈ {High, Very High, M1} | e.g. also Intermediate-Unfavourable? |
| `psma_missing` | risk ∈ {High, Very High} | e.g. include M1? |
| `bone_protection_missing` | `= Not started` | should it fire **only if ADT ≥ 3 months**? |
| `dexa_missing` | `= Not done` | only when on ADT? |
| `arsi_readiness` | HSPC + High + not initiated | include Very High / M1? |
| Benchmarks | ARSI 60% · PSMA 85% · Bone 85% · MDT 95% | confirm targets |

> ⚠️ Worth deciding: in Part A the **bone-protection nudge fired before ADT started** (rule is state-only). If that's clinically noisy, add the `ADT ≥ 3 months` guard.

## E4 — Suppression threshold *(B9)* — what it actually does
With threshold **11**: an institution reporting `psma_completion_rate` for High-risk in a month with only **6 eligible patients** → the cell is **suppressed** (numerator/denominator nulled). Lower threshold = more data to the sponsor, higher re-identification risk.
☐ 5 ☐ **11 (default)** ☐ 20

## E5 — Identity model *(B1)* — what a record looks like
| Option | The patient row contains | Bedside "who is this?" |
|---|---|---|
| **A. De-identified** *(recommended)* | `PCR-001`, 68, CGHS, Delhi | Look up in the hospital HIS |
| **B. Identified** | + name, ABHA, Aadhaar, phone (masked, audited reveal) | In ProstaCare |
| **C. Hybrid** | de-identified core + isolated identity table, role-gated | In ProstaCare, for authorised roles |

## E6 — Other quick confirmations
- **B4 source of truth:** patients **created in ProstaCare** (v1) vs synced from HIS. If synced — what is the match key?
- **P1-1 nudge ownership:** the patient's **primary clinician** ☐ or whoever is on shift ☐
- **P1-4:** restrict *"notify all MDT"* to **HOD** ☐ or allow any clinician ☐
- **O-AGG3/4 export:** **S3 push, nightly compute + monthly export** ☐ or weekly ☐

### Key transformations (workbook column → canonical entity)
| Workbook shape | Canonical shape | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 6 imaging columns (`mpmri_pelvis`, `bone_scan_spect`, `psma_pet_ct`, `ct_abdomen_pelvis`, `dexa_bone_density`, `germline_somatic_testing`) | **`imaging_study` rows** (`study_date`, `modality`, `result`) | gives each study a date; "Not done" = **no row** |
| `adt_type` + `formulation_dose` + `adt_start_date` + `anti_androgen` + `arsi_intensification` | **`treatment_line` rows** (`line_type` = ADT / anti-androgen / ARSI) | therapy is sequential |
| `chemotherapy_regimen` + `number_of_cycles_completed` + `last_cycle_date` | **`treatment_line`** (`line_type` = chemo) | same |
| All `rt_*` + `cghs_*` fields | **`treatment_line`** (`line_type` = RT) | RT is a line with approval metadata |
| TNM + risk + ECOG + castration | **`staging_assessment` rows** (dated) | restaging & HSPC→CRPC are dated facts |
| Bone health + supportive fields | **`supportive_care_event` rows** (dated) | bone-protection start/stop needs an audit trail |
| 9 comorbidity + 6 family-history columns | **boolean flags on `pathology`** | fixed list; kept exactly as the workbook/UI |
| `diagnosis_date` (Clinical_Entry) | **moved to `patient`** | it is a patient-level fact |
